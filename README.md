# QIIME 2 Galaxy Tools

**Current Version:** 2025.4

**Toolshed Link:** [QIIME 2 Core Distribution](https://toolshed.g2.bx.psu.edu/repository?repository_id=d256b91a26ac697f)

## How to update the tools
All tools are automatically generated by [q2galaxy](https://github.com/qiime2/q2galaxy) within a conda environment.
These tools are then slightly modified to use a docker container and additional metadata for the toolshed is generated.
These `*.xml` and `.shed.yml` files should not be manually modified.

The state of this repo is controlled by `distros.yaml` in the root.
To add or update tools, modify this file in the root and issue a PR.
This PR will be tested to confirm the changes will render a new repo state.
Once merged, Github Actions will issue a new PR with all tools re-rendered.

To run this manually, you can use the `Makefile` provided in the root as well.
