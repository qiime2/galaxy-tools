QIIME 2: fragment-insertion filter-features
===========================================
Filter fragments in tree from table.


Outputs:
--------
:filtered_table.qza: The input table minus those fragments that were not part of the tree. This feature-table can be used for downstream analyses like phylogenetic alpha- or beta- diversity computation.
:removed_table.qza: Those fragments that got removed from the input table, because they were not part of the tree. This table is mainly used for quality control, e.g. to inspect the ratio of removed reads per sample from the input table. You can ignore this table for downstream analyses.

|  

Description:
------------
Filters fragments not inserted into a phylogenetic tree from a feature-table. Some fragments computed by e.g. Deblur or DADA2 are too remote to get inserted by SEPP into a reference phylogeny. To be able to use the feature-table for downstream analyses like computing Faith's PD or UniFrac, the feature-table must be cleared of fragments that are not part of the phylogenetic tree, because their path length can otherwise not be determined. Typically, the number of rejected fragments is low (&lt;= 10), but it might be worth to inspect the ratio of reads assigned to those rejected fragments.

 abstract = {We have developed a unified format for phylogenetic placements, that is, mappings of environmental sequence data (e.g., short reads) into a phylogenetic tree. We are motivated to do so by the growing number of tools for computing and post-processing phylogenetic placements, and the lack of an established standard for storing them. The format is lightweight, versatile, extensible, and is based on the JSON format, which can be parsed by most modern programming languages. Our format is already implemented in several tools for computing and post-processing parsimony- and likelihood-based phylogenetic placements and has worked well in practice. We believe that establishing a standard format for analyzing read placements at this early stage will lead to a more efficient development of powerful and portable post-analysis tools for the growing applications of phylogenetic placement.},
