QIIME 2: dada2 denoise-pyro
===========================
Denoise and dereplicate single-end pyrosequences


Outputs:
--------
:table.qza: The resulting feature table.
:representative_sequences.qza: The resulting feature sequences. Each feature in the feature table will be represented by exactly one sequence.
:denoising_stats.qza: &lt;no description&gt;

|  

Description:
------------
This method denoises single-end pyrosequencing sequences, dereplicates them, and filters chimeras.
